    <h3>A heaping pile of garbage for the man who hands out garbage on the daily.</h3>
    <p>We all know Master Rahool right? Smug Cryptarch in the Tower who only seems to hand out useless loot
       to all the Guardians bringing him engrams. Most commonly, the <strong>USELESS</strong> heavy grenade launcher,
       <strong><em>EDGE TRANSIT.</em></strong> How about we give him a taste of his own medicine?
    </p>
    <p><em>Note: Only possible to bake cookie during the Dawning.</em></p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>15 Dawning Essence</li>
            <li>Two Ingredients that <strong>DON'T</strong> go together. Examples include:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cabal Oil and Personal Touch</li>
                <li>Chitin Powder and Bullet Spray</li>
                <li>Taken Butter and Perfect Taste</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Collect said ingredients in Eva's Holiday Oven.</li>
            <li>Put them together and ignore the actual recipes the game wants you to make.</li>
            <li>Create some disgusting, useless abominations of cookies.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Great, now you can give Rahool a perfect return gift for all the useless crap he's given you. What a healthy relationship.</p>
